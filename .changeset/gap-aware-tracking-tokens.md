Carry the commit-order key in durable tracking tokens so gap-free tailing resumes correctly.

The postgres engine tails events in `(transaction_id, sequence_position)` order with a `pg_snapshot_xmin` watermark, but durable tokens stored only `sequence_position`. On stream reopen the catch-up filter compared positions alone, so an event with a lower `sequence_position` but higher `transaction_id` — which happens when a transaction writes other rows (stamping its xid) before appending its event — was permanently skipped.

- `messaging`: adds `gapAwareToken(sequence, gapKey)` (a `TrackingToken` carrying an opaque commit-order key alongside the position), `advanceTokenTo`, and `serializeToken`/`deserializeToken`. `SequencedEvent` and `StreamingCondition` gain an optional `token`, letting an engine hand the processor its own resume cursor instead of a bare position. Both processors persist the engine-supplied token when present.
- `postgres`: `open()` emits a gap-aware token per event and, on reopen, resumes the `(transaction_id, sequence_position)` tuple cursor from it. Engines that supply no token (in-memory, Axon Server) are unaffected.
- token stores (`knex`, `kysely`, `drizzle`, `prisma`, `typeorm`): serialize through the shared `messaging` helpers so the commit-order key round-trips instead of being flattened to a position.

Token format change: tokens written before this release carry no commit-order key. They rehydrate as position-only tokens and resume via the legacy catch-up branch on first reopen, then mint gap-aware tokens going forward; to close the window immediately, reset the affected processors.
