# @kronos-ts/postgres

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 9eb84ff: Carry the commit-order key in durable tracking tokens so gap-free tailing resumes correctly.

  The postgres engine tails events in `(transaction_id, sequence_position)` order with a `pg_snapshot_xmin` watermark, but durable tokens stored only `sequence_position`. On stream reopen the catch-up filter compared positions alone, so an event with a lower `sequence_position` but higher `transaction_id` — which happens when a transaction writes other rows (stamping its xid) before appending its event — was permanently skipped.

  - `messaging`: adds `gapAwareToken(sequence, gapKey)` (a `TrackingToken` carrying an opaque commit-order key alongside the position), `advanceTokenTo`, and `serializeToken`/`deserializeToken`. `SequencedEvent` and `StreamingCondition` gain an optional `token`, letting an engine hand the processor its own resume cursor instead of a bare position. Both processors persist the engine-supplied token when present.
  - `postgres`: `open()` emits a gap-aware token per event and, on reopen, resumes the `(transaction_id, sequence_position)` tuple cursor from it. Engines that supply no token (in-memory, Axon Server) are unaffected.
  - token stores (`knex`, `kysely`, `drizzle`, `prisma`, `typeorm`): serialize through the shared `messaging` helpers so the commit-order key round-trips instead of being flattened to a position.

  Token format change: tokens written before this release carry no commit-order key. They rehydrate as position-only tokens and resume via the legacy catch-up branch on first reopen, then mint gap-aware tokens going forward; to close the window immediately, reset the affected processors.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 56bfb6d: Move per-transaction safety timeouts onto the database adapter.

  - `pgAdapter`, `postgresAdapter`, and `bunSqlAdapter` now accept `idleInTransactionTimeoutMs` (default 30000) and `statementTimeoutMs` (default 0) and arm them via `SET LOCAL` on every transaction they open — UoW-scoped commits, event-store own-tx appends, and the scheduler worker tick alike. Each adapter instance is configured independently, so two adapters pointed at two databases stay decoupled.
  - `postgresTransactionManager` no longer takes timeout options and no longer issues `SET LOCAL`; it is now a pure begin/commit/rollback bridge. The `postgres({ transaction: { ... } })` config is removed — set the timeouts on the adapter instead.
  - `drizzleTransactionManager` and `knexTransactionManager` accept an `onBeginTransaction(tx)` hook that runs once per transaction, before the UnitOfWork uses it — the seam for arming session settings (e.g. `SET LOCAL idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`) on those clients so a stalled drain is bounded.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- da0ccae: Simplify the postgres event-store time columns.

  - The events table drops `recorded_at` (the DB insert time). It was written by default but never read — the store carries only the EventMessage's authored timestamp.
  - The authored-timestamp column is renamed `message_timestamp` → `timestamp` on both the events and scheduled-events tables, so a schedule row and the event it materialises into share the same column names (`version`, `timestamp`). It stays a `BIGINT` of epoch milliseconds (btree/BRIN-indexable).

  Schema change is CREATE-only: an events or scheduled-events table created before this release must be hand-migrated (`ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN recorded_at`, `ALTER TABLE … RENAME COLUMN message_timestamp TO timestamp`) or reset before upgrading.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 291acd2: Add a `kind` discriminator to messages and bring the postgres event store to full `EventMessage` round-trip parity.

  - `Message` now carries `readonly kind: "command" | "event" | "query"` (exported as `MessageKind`), narrowed to the literal on `CommandMessage`, `EventMessage`, and `QueryMessage`. Handler interceptors can branch on message category at runtime via `message.kind`. Gateways, `send()`, `append()`, `schedule()`, and every event-store reconstruction set it; `kind` is derived, never persisted.
  - The postgres event store now persists `version` and `message_timestamp` and selects `event_id`, so `source()` and `open()` reconstruct the complete `EventMessage` — `identifier`, authored `timestamp`, and `version`. Previously these three fields were dropped on read, diverging from the in-memory, axon-server, and kronosdb engines.
  - Schema change is CREATE-only. `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` does not add columns to an existing table and the new columns are `NOT NULL`, so an events table created before this release must be hand-migrated (`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`) or reset before upgrading.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 4ac26c0: Validate `schedule()`/`scheduleAfter()` inputs and bound transaction lifetime.

  - `schedule()` rejects an invalid `at` (`Invalid Date`); `scheduleAfter()` rejects a non-finite `delayMs`. A past time / negative delay is still allowed and fires as soon as possible.
  - `postgresTransactionManager` applies `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` (default 30000ms) via `SET LOCAL` on every transaction, with an optional `statement_timeout`. Configurable through `postgres({ transaction: { idleInTransactionTimeoutMs, statementTimeoutMs } })`. Set either to `0` to disable.
  - `postgresTransactionManager.begin()` now rejects instead of hanging when the transaction callback fails before the handle is returned.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 74dc43d: Command handlers now run inside the UnitOfWork's transaction, so a handler's appended events and any other writes it makes commit — or roll back — atomically.

  Previously the command bus opened a fresh UnitOfWork that bypassed the configured `unitOfWorkFactory`, so a transaction provided by a backend never reached command handlers (each `append()` opened its own short-lived transaction instead). The in-memory `createSimpleCommandBus` now runs handlers through the configured `unitOfWorkFactory` — matching the distributed buses (kronosdb / axon-server), which already did this. With the in-memory default factory (`runInNewUoW`) behavior is unchanged; a transactional backend gives each command's UoW a transaction.

  `@kronos-ts/postgres`: command handlers are transactional out of the box — **lazy**, so pure-read handlers never claim a connection. `PostgresAdapterTransaction` gains `unwrap<T>()`, which returns the live driver connection backing the UoW transaction (pg `PoolClient`, or the scoped `sql` for porsager/Bun). Use it to run your own SQL, or bind an ORM, in the same transaction as your events:

  ```ts
  const tx = await getOrBeginActiveTransaction<PostgresAdapterTransaction>();
  await tx!.query("UPDATE widgets SET name = $1 WHERE id = $2", [name, id]);
  append(WidgetUpdated, { id, name }); // same commit
  // or hand tx.unwrap() to Drizzle/Kysely — see the @kronos-ts/postgres README.
  ```

  **Breaking (`@kronos-ts/messaging`):** `createCommandGateway(bus, unitOfWorkRunner?)` is now `createCommandGateway(bus)` — the gateway is a thin message-builder and no longer opens a UnitOfWork; the command bus owns the single per-command UoW (AF5-aligned). `createSimpleCommandBus()` now accepts an optional `UoWRunner` (defaults to `runInNewUoW`). Direct callers of `createCommandGateway` that passed a runner should drop the second argument; the transactional runner now belongs on the `unitOfWorkFactory` slot, which the bus consumes.

  **Breaking (`@kronos-ts/postgres`)** for custom adapter authors only: `PostgresAdapterTransaction` now requires an `unwrap<T>(): T` method returning the underlying driver connection. The three bundled adapters (pg / postgres / bun-sql) implement it; custom adapters must add it.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a durable EventScheduler for deferring events to a future time.

  `schedule(event, at)` is callable only inside a UnitOfWork so a scheduled
  event commits or rolls back atomically with the originating command;
  `cancel(token)` returns a `CancelResult` discriminated union
  (`cancelled` | `already-appended` | `not-found`).

  - `@kronos-ts/messaging` exports the `EventScheduler` contract and a
    `setTimeout`-backed in-memory implementation for tests, plus a lazy
    transactional UnitOfWork runner so writers share one transaction per UoW.
  - `@kronos-ts/app` adds `eventScheduler` as a typed `KronosComponents` slot
    with an in-memory default that emits a durability startup warning.
  - `@kronos-ts/postgres` provides a durable scheduler backed by
    `kronos_scheduled_events` with a `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` polling worker;
    `schedule_id` is reused as the event id so re-fires after a crash dedupe
    via the events table's UNIQUE constraint.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Publish via `bun publish` so `workspace:*` resolves to concrete versions in published manifests. Previously `changeset publish` shelled out to `npm publish`, which does not understand Bun's workspace protocol, leaving literal `"workspace:*"` strings in published manifests and breaking installs for consumers.
