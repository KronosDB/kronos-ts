## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add distributed subscription queries over the QueryService stream. The
  KronosDB server holds the subscriptionId↔handler mapping, so each handler
  tracks the server-injected subscribers it is given and targets emits directly
  by subscriptionIdentifier. `handleSubscriptionQueryRequest` processes inbound
  subscribe (runs the handler, returns initialResult) and unsubscribe;
  `emitUpdate` / `completeSubscription` / `completeSubscriptionExceptionally`
  iterate tracked subscribers, apply the `SubscriptionFilter`, and send
  per-subscriber responses. Function and `payloadEquals` filters both evaluate
  locally on the emitter.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Publish via `bun publish` so `workspace:*` resolves to concrete versions in published manifests. Previously `changeset publish` shelled out to `npm publish`, which does not understand Bun's workspace protocol, leaving literal `"workspace:*"` strings in published manifests and breaking installs for consumers.
